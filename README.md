# Lichess Puzzle Analysis 

This project explores the **Lichess puzzle dataset**, focusing on puzzle difficulty, player performance, and trends across thousands of rated tactical positions.  
It’s a mix of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization — all in a single Jupyter Notebook.

---

## Overview
The notebook walks through:
- **Data loading & cleaning** – handling missing values, filtering malformed entries  
- **Exploratory analysis** – distributions of puzzle ratings, popularity, and themes  
- **Difficulty insights** – which motifs correlate with higher puzzle ratings  
- **Visualization** – histograms, scatter plots, and rating trends over time  

The goal is to understand how puzzle difficulty and frequency reflect player skill progression and Lichess’s rating system.
